# Realm Defender

Are you annoying about the spamming (like ARASR) crash your realm? No problem, realm defender module provided almost 100% blockage aginst their spamming/interact-spam.

# How it works

This module works by blocking **all** the messages from a player before the verification finishes. It might be annoying for someone, but it's not that dangerous.

# The show case

Step 1: Ask the players to move their camera to start the verification (Time Limit: A minute)

# Is there false banning

No, there is no false banning. We only disconnect the player if they don't finish the verification in the given time.
