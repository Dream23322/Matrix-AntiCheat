# Sentinel Detection for Matrix AntiCheat MCPE

Our Anticheat takes a special system to handle the checks and apply correct punishment.

We will introduce our system easily below.

# Behaviour Handler

Takes a looser punishment mechanism, we will disconnect the hacker and give a warning to him.

If the hacker against the anticheat for more times, anticheat will take a stronger punishment.

What different is AntiCheatb will produce **disconnect immediately** to make sure no bypass (also no bad lagback).

# Total Handler

Detect a player just by a single module is not effective at all. So, total handler is made.

Total Handler can let almost **all types** of check to join the **same “VL”**.

Also, total handler can choose the most suitable punishment against those hackers.

By the special method, different module can be given a different sensitivity.

# Instant & Limit Handler (classic)

For the stable running, we also keep the classic automatic action. Working as below:

- Apply the punishment of each module when a player gets enough flag that reaches the max “VL”.

- Apply the punishment immediately when the player gets detected from absolute stable modules.
