# Introduce to dynamic toggle system

Do you think disable the module won't let your RAM go free? This toggle system can prevent extra RAM usage!

# How it would works

We unsubscribed the event listener for unused module. Which can free your RAM.

Also, we will clear the extra data produced by the player who has left.

# Dynamic toggle

We support to turn off and on the module with the “dynamic config” system.

You can toggle the module without editing the file by `-toggle <module> enable/disable`.
